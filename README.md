# This is my portfolio web site!

I built this website to showcase some of my projects and give a way to contact me! This is currently still a work in progress as I have been building it while learning HTML, CSS 
and JavaScript, and while studying software engineering at university.

# What I learned and plan to learn for this project:

Starting this project I had to learn HTML and CSS as in university we had only gone into C++, C and Java at the time. I also learned a bit of JavaScript, and am still learing about
it to hopefully implement some more features. My plan going forward is to learn React aswell as learning some backend languages to keep making this site better aswell as use that 
knowledge to build more projects!
